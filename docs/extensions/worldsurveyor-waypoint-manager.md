## üìç Core Features

### Waypoint Management
- **Create waypoints** with position, type, and target information
- **Edit waypoint properties** including name, notes, and metadata
- **Remove individual waypoints** or use bulk operations
- **Real-time synchronization** with Isaac Sim viewport

### Waypoint Types
- **Point of Interest** - General spatial markers
- **Camera Position** - Specific viewpoints with target directions
- **Spawn Point** - Object or character spawn locations
- **Lighting Position** - Lighting setup points
- **Audio Source** - Spatial audio locations
- **Selection Mark** - Temporary markers for selection
- **Object Anchor** - Reference points for object placement
- **Directional Lighting** - Directional light setup positions

### Visual Markers
- **3D debug markers** displayed in Isaac Sim viewport
- **Toggle visibility** for all markers or individual waypoints
- **Color-coded markers** based on waypoint type
- **Automatic cleanup** when waypoints are deleted

## üìÅ Group Organization

### Hierarchical Groups
- **Create nested group structures** for complex organization
- **Drag-and-drop organization** (coming soon)
- **Color-coded groups** with custom colors
- **Group descriptions** for documentation

### Group Operations
- **Assign waypoints to groups** individually or in bulk
- **Remove waypoints from groups** with bulk operations
- **Filter waypoints by group** with hierarchical inclusion
- **Toggle child group inclusion** in filtering

### Group Filtering
The Groups section includes an **"Include child groups"** checkbox:
- ‚òëÔ∏è **Checked** (default): Filtering by parent groups shows all waypoints in child groups
- ‚òê **Unchecked**: Shows only waypoints directly assigned to the selected group

## üîß Bulk Operations

### Selection System
- **Select All checkbox** to select/deselect all visible waypoints
- **Individual checkboxes** for each waypoint
- **Selection counter** shows how many waypoints are selected
- **Persistent selection** across filtering operations

### Bulk Actions
- **üôà Hide Selected** - Hide selected waypoints from viewport
- **üëÅÔ∏è Show Selected** - Show selected waypoints in viewport  
- **üìÅ Assign to Groups** - Add selected waypoints to one or more groups
- **üóëÔ∏è Remove Selected** - Delete multiple waypoints at once (with confirmation)

### Selection Workflows
1. Use filters to narrow down waypoints
2. Select specific waypoints or use "Select All"
3. Apply bulk operations (hide, show, group, delete)
4. Operations apply immediately with visual feedback

## üì§üì• Import & Export

### Export Functionality
- **Export all waypoints and groups** to JSON format
- **Hierarchical group structure** preserved
- **Complete metadata** including positions, targets, types
- **Timestamped exports** for version tracking

### Import Functionality
- **Import from JSON** with validation
- **Two merge modes:**
  - **Replace**: Clear all existing data and import
  - **Append**: Add imported data to existing waypoints
- **Group ID mapping** handles conflicts automatically
- **Error reporting** for failed imports
- **Real-time progress feedback**

## üìö Common Workflows

### Scene Survey Workflow
1. **Load your scene** in Isaac Sim
2. **Position camera** at interesting viewpoints
3. **Create waypoints** at each position (manual or via toolbar)
4. **Organize waypoints** into logical groups
5. **Export waypoint data** for documentation or sharing

### Camera Setup Workflow  
1. **Create camera_position waypoints** at key angles
2. **Set targets** for each camera position
3. **Group cameras** by scene or purpose (e.g., "Product Views", "Cinematic Angles")
4. **Test navigation** between waypoints
5. **Export setup** for animation or rendering workflows

### Spatial Planning Workflow
1. **Create different waypoint types** (spawn, lighting, etc.)
2. **Use hierarchical groups** to organize by function
3. **Toggle visibility** to focus on specific elements
4. **Use bulk operations** to manage large waypoint sets
5. **Import/export** for collaboration or version control

### AI Scene Analysis Workflow
1. **Create comprehensive waypoint coverage** of the scene
2. **Use descriptive names and metadata** for AI context
3. **Export structured data** for AI processing
4. **Import processed waypoints** with AI-generated insights
5. **Navigate between AI-recommended viewpoints**

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Waypoints not appearing in viewport**
- Check that markers are enabled (toggle visibility)
- Verify Isaac Sim is running and connected
- Refresh the viewport or restart Isaac Sim

**Import/Export errors**
- Verify JSON format matches expected structure
- Check file permissions for export location
- Ensure Isaac Sim is not busy with other operations

**Group filtering not working**
- Check the "Include child groups" toggle setting
- Verify group assignments are correct
- Refresh the waypoint list

**Performance issues with many waypoints**
- Use groups to organize and filter waypoints
- Hide markers when not needed
- Consider archiving old waypoints via export

### Error Messages
- **"waypoint_id is required"**: API call missing required parameter
- **"Import failed: Invalid JSON"**: Export file is corrupted or wrong format
- **"Group not found"**: Trying to assign waypoints to non-existent group
- **"Maximum waypoints reached"**: Database limit exceeded (check configuration)
