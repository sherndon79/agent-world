# agenTW‚àûrld Extensions

A suite of Isaac Sim extensions that provide AI agents with comprehensive world interaction capabilities through unified APIs and MCP integration.

## Overview

agenTW‚àûrld Extensions enable AI agents to build, view, navigate, and record 3D worlds in Isaac Sim through a consistent set of HTTP APIs and Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools. Each extension provides specialized functionality while maintaining a unified architecture for seamless integration.

## Extensions

### üèóÔ∏è WorldBuilder
Create and manipulate 3D scenes programmatically. Add primitives (cubes, spheres, cylinders), place USD assets, organize elements into batches, and manage complex scene hierarchies.

**Key Features:**
- Primitive creation (cubes, spheres, cylinders, cones)
- USD asset placement with transform controls
- Batch operations for complex scene building
- Scene querying and spatial analysis
- Real-time scene validation

### üé• WorldViewer  
Control camera positioning and create cinematic movements in Isaac Sim. Navigate through 3D scenes with smooth camera transitions and orbital controls.

**Key Features:**
- Camera positioning and targeting
- Orbital camera controls around objects
- Smooth cinematic movements with easing
- Object framing and automatic positioning
- Camera bounds checking for safety

### üß≠ WorldSurveyor
Mark and organize spatial locations with waypoints and groups. Create persistent spatial references for navigation, annotation, and scene organization.

**Key Features:**
- Waypoint creation at 3D coordinates
- Hierarchical waypoint grouping
- Persistent waypoint storage
- Visual markers with customizable visibility
- Spatial queries and navigation

### üìπ WorldRecorder
Capture screenshots and record videos from Isaac Sim viewports. Generate visual documentation and recordings of 3D scenes and simulations.

**Key Features:**
- Single frame capture with optional depth
- Video recording with hardware acceleration
- Multiple codec support (H.264, etc.)
- Configurable quality and resolution
- Automatic output management

## Quick Start

Get up and running in minutes with the automated installer:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/sherndon79/agent-world.git
cd agent-world

# Run the installer (handles everything automatically)
bash scripts/install_agent_world.sh

# Launch Isaac Sim with extensions enabled
bash scripts/launch_agent_world.sh

# Verify everything works
bash scripts/smoke_test.sh
```

That's it! The installer will:
- Download and install Isaac Sim if needed
- Set up all extensions and dependencies
- Configure authentication and MCP servers
- Create launch scripts for easy startup

## Isaac Sim Integration

Once installed, the agenTW‚àûrld Extensions integrate seamlessly into Isaac Sim's interface:

*Extensions docked in Isaac Sim's workspace, providing direct access to controls and real-time status information alongside the 3D viewport.*

## Architecture

- **Unified Configuration** - Centralized settings with environment overrides
- **Consistent APIs** - Standardized HTTP endpoints across all extensions
- **MCP Integration** - Native Model Context Protocol support for AI workflows
- **Thread Safety** - Proper Isaac Sim threading for UI and simulation stability
- **Extensible Design** - Modular architecture for easy customization

## Agent Orchestration

**agenTW‚àûrld Extensions are designed for AI agent orchestration.** Each extension operates independently with no inter-extension dependencies, allowing AI agents to:

### **Compose Complex Workflows**
```
AI Agent: "Create a city scene, position camera for aerial view, mark key locations, then record a flythrough"
‚Üì
WorldBuilder ‚Üí WorldViewer ‚Üí WorldSurveyor ‚Üí WorldRecorder
```

### **Independent Operation**
- **No coupling**: Extensions don't depend on each other
- **√Ä la carte usage**: Install and run only the extensions you need
- **Partial deployments**: Use WorldBuilder alone, or just WorldViewer + WorldRecorder
- **Parallel execution**: AI agents can use multiple extensions simultaneously  
- **Fault isolation**: One extension failing doesn't break others
- **Flexible orchestration**: AI decides the sequence and combination

### **AI-Driven Coordination**
Rather than hard-coded workflows, **AI agents orchestrate extensions dynamically** based on user needs:
- Analyze requirements and determine which extensions to use
- Sequence operations across multiple extensions
- Handle errors and retry strategies
- Adapt workflows based on intermediate results

This architecture enables emergent, intelligent workflows that weren't explicitly programmed.
